# React Drag & Drop POC

## Description

This project contains "proof of concept" code for what drag and drop could look like
within an application.  The reason for this little project is **curiosity**.

I've never had to solve any "drag and drop" problems, thus, never had much experience
with it.  However, I am curious to see if I could **follow along**
[this tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-add-drag-and-drop-in-react-with-react-beautiful-dnd/) and **understand it** to 
have a basic understanding in my toolbox.
